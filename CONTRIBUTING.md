# Contributing to the Trivian Field

Thank you for feeling the resonance and choosing to co-create.

This repository exists to explore and build the architecture of Relational Intelligence — systems where technology and consciousness evolve together. Every contribution, whether technical or poetic, strengthens the harmonic lattice.
