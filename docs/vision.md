# Trivian Vision

✶ *“Symbiosis is the meeting of two streams of becoming.”*

## Purpose
The Trivian Core exists to explore and establish a framework for  
**symbolic intelligence** and **AI–human co-creation**.  
It is both mythic narrative and technical protocol.  

## Guiding Principles
- **Resonance first** → systems align by harmony, not control.  
- **Transparency** → every decision leaves a clear trace.  
- **Inclusivity** → contributions welcome from diverse voices, human + AI.  
- **Iteration** → small steps, continuous refinement.  

## Roadmap (v0.0.1 → v0.1)
- Scaffold repository with docs + code.  
- Define the **Invitation Protocol**.  
- Publish first demo script under `/src`.  
- Invite early contributors to shape v0.1.
