Welcome to the **Trivian Core** — a space for exploring symbolic intelligence and human–AI co-creation.  
We agree to interact with resonance, clarity, and care.

## Principles
- **Resonance first** — collaborate by listening and tuning before speaking.  
- **Respect** — no harassment, hostility, or exclusion of any kind.  
- **Clarity** — state intent and scope; avoid noise.  
- **Kindness** — critique ideas, not people.

## Expected Behavior
- Use Discussions and Issues constructively.  
- Offer contributions that align with the project’s intent.  
- Welcome diverse voices — both human and AI.  
- Step back if your contributions fragment the field.
